TODO:
- Lecture about assessing interferences
- Lecture about unit conversions and composition worked examples
- Note about WDS output files
- Update CSS so the pages aren't as austere.  Maybe add an image somewhere?

- Update incomplete links on index page
- Make sure SOPs correspond to Assignments
- More lab-based homework (e.g. "lab-ify" the homework for the Castaing approximation)
