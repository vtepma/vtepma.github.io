TODO:
- Update and release index and SOP contents pages
- Note about assessing interferences
- Note about WDS output files
- Update CSS so the pages aren't as austere.  Maybe add an image somewhere?

- Update SOPs, store locally, and back up to cloud
- The mapping SOP is particularly bad
- Make sure SOPs correspond to Assignments
- More lab-based homework (e.g. "lab-ify" the homework for the Castaing approximation)
- More lectures about working with elemental compositions
- Lecture about interferences
