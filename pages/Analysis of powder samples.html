	<h1>Bulk analysis of rocks and powders</h1>
    
	<p><u>Note:</u> The electron microprobe is best known as a tool for acquiring standards-based quantitative analyses from micron-sized analytical volumes
	in solid materials that are homogenous at the scale of 1s of microns but heterogeneous on length scales of 10s of microns to centimeters.  As such, this
	instrument is best suited for analysis of well-polished rock and alloy samples.  What it's not well suited for are bulk analyses of rocks and powders.</p>
	
	<p>If you're interested in determining the bulk composition of a rock or a powder, here are some great methods for that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><u>X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF)</u> -- the GEOS department has one in Derring Hall.  Rock samples must be ground into a powder, and powder
		samples can be pressed into a pellet or melted into a glass bead.</li>
		<li><u>Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)</u> -- the GEOS department also has one in Derring Hall.  Rock samples must be ground into a powder.  The mineral
		proportions calculated from the XRD spectra can them be converted into a bulk composition using a mass balance approach.</li>
		<li><u>Flux melting + WDS or EDS</u> -- the GEOS department has a furnace that can melt powders into glass beads that can be analyzed using
		the microprobe, a SEM, or LA-ICP-MS</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you refuse to use any of these methods, insist on using the microprobe, and are prepared for the experience to be a struggle, then...</p>

	<h3>First order questions:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Do we care about major elements or trace elements?</li>
		<li>Are we analyzing a polished rock or a powder?</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Case 1: Analyzing a polished rock to determine the major element concentrations</h4>
	
	<p>To do this, it's best to map the sample (count maps are ok) and use an image segmentation method to determine the area percentage of each mineral
	in the rock.  Then, analyze a representave sample of each mineral and calculate the bulk composition of the rock as an area-weighted average of each
	mineral composition.  Alternatively, you could use point counting or powder XRD instead of mapping to determine the proportion of each phase.</p>

	<h4>Case 2: Analyzing a polished rock to determine a trace element concentration</h4>
	
	<p><i>Unfortunately there's no good way to do this.</i>  That's because the trace elements are usually present in accessory phases, which represent a very
	small area percentage of the rock.  As such, you're not going to be able to detect them very well by mapping, and you'll have problems with
	quantification related to point analyses and map pixels overlapping with grain poundaries.  Matrix corrections are not applicable to analyses in
	which the analytical volume contains a mixture of phases.</p>

	<h4>Case 3: Analyzing powders when the grain size is large relative to the beam size, regardless of whether you're interested in major or trace
	elements.</h4>
	
	<p>If the particles in the powder are smooth and flat and the beam can be positioned entirely within the grains, then you can treat the sample the
	same as in Case 1 (analyzing a rock for major elements).</p>

	<h4>Case 4: Analyzing powders when the grain size is small relative to the beam size, regardless of whether you're interested in major or trace
	elements.</h4>
	
	<p>When the interaction volume of the beam is larger than the size of the particles, then "traditional" standards-based EPMA quantification is no
	longer useful because matrix corrections can't be done.  In this case, you need to use empirical calibration curves using powder mixtures for which
	you know the composition.  Try to create powders that have particles that are only 1s of microns in diameter and use a beam that is ~10 microns in
	diameter or larger.  Analyze the samples using the same conditions as your standards, and perform enough analyses to get the reproducibility
	statistics that you need.</p>

	<h3>Some comments about sample preparation:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Care must be taken to minimize the epoxy/sample ratio, but pressing the powders is probably "overkill," so to speak.</li>
		<li>One alternative to pressing is, if the particles are relatively dense, you can use an epoxy with a long working time and low viscosity so
		that the particles can settle.</li>
		<li>Another alternative is to put some powder in a small container, add some epoxy on top and mix, and then gradually add powder until you can't 
		mix anymore into the epoxy.  Then, put this paste into a 1/4-inch mold (e.g. a plastic drinking straw).  Multiple samples of powder prepared in 
		this way can be combined into a single 1-inch diameter mount.
		<li>Hand-mixing powders in a mortar and pestle until they feel smooth to the touch and no longer gritty is a good powdering method.
		<li>Powder samples don't need to be polished particularly well.  You can just use a large grit size like 600 or 800 grit.
		<li>To ensure that rock samples are representative, it's a good idea to grind up a large volume of rock and separate aliquots of powder with a splitter.  (I don't know much about this process)
