	<p><b>Note:</b> The SOPs are intended to assist the lab manager and other more experienced users with training exercises, and are not
	intended to be used as a substitute for training.  That is, if you forget how to do something, then refer to the SOP.  If you want to
	do something new, DO NOT refer to the SOP -- instead, reach out to the lab manager (Lowell) for training.</p>
