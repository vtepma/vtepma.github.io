	<h1>Guidance for WDS element maps</h1>
    
	<p>Optimizing a recipe for mapping trace elements on the microprobe is challenging due to uncertainty regarding how much time the user should
	budget.  The last thing the user wants is to blast his or her sample at high beam current for many hours to days and not have a nice-looking map
	at the end.  These guidelines are intended to give the user some idea about how to avoid this problem using a strategy that can be performed “on
	the fly” without any cumbersome additional data collection.</p>
	
	<p>The map duration is easy to calculate: it’s just the number of pixels multiplied by the dwell time.  For example, a 256 x 192 pixel map (49,152
	pixels) collected using a 10 ms dwell time (per pixel) takes 491.52 seconds (about 8 minutes).  Actual maps can take longer when mapping in “stage
	mode” due to the time that the stage takes to move from one row to the next.  Choosing the pixel resolution is usually relatively straightforward:
	it usually ends up being a compromise between the user’s desire for the map to look pretty but also not take too long.  The dwell time in contrast
	should be chosen specifically to obtain the desired amount of X-ray counts.</p>
	
	<p>What factors control the X-ray count rate?  The count rate depends on these factors: sample composition, beam current, detector efficiency, and
	spectrometer alignment.  It can be assumed that the sample composition, detector efficiency, and spectrometer alignment are basically outside the
	users’s control or are straightforward to optimize, so they can be ignored for now.  That leaves the beam current.  Basically, the user can set the
	beam current as high as needed as long as the sample isn’t damaged and the crystals aren’t being subjected to count rates exceeding 100,000s of CPS,
	which causes the diffraction crystals to degrade (usually anything below 200 nA is safe, when analyzing geological materials).</p>
	
	<h3>Procedure for optimizing the map conditions</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Are the elements detectable? (EDS and WDS spectra) -- Peak Net CPS >10σ above background CPS</li>
		<li>Is the heterogeneity detectable? (“X-ray measure” tool) -- "Location 2" CPS >3σ above "Location 1" CPS?<li>
		<li>Is the heterogeneity real or artificial? (additional WDS spectra) -- "Location 2" net CPS >3σ above "Location 1" net CPS</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> some steps in this optimization procedure involve performing analyses on the material that will eventually be mapped.  For
	this reason, it may be a good idea to perform these steps on another mineral that is presumably the same material (e.g. do the analyses on a
	“sacrificial” garnet).</p>
	
	<h4>Part 1: Can we detect the elements of interest?</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Do a few test analyses using the EDS system, and use this information to identify which elements will be the easiest/most problematic:
		major elements (>10 wt%) can be ignored on the basis that they will be easy* to map.</li>
		<li>Start with these default settings: 512 x 512 pixels, 10 ms dwell time, 100 nA</li>
		<li>Will the map take too long?  If so, decrease the resolution.</li>
		<li>Is the resolution too low for the map to be useful?  If so, then you’re screwed.  Sorry!</li>
		<li>Arrange the elements on the WDS spectrometers using the “PC-EPMA” window, and note the nominal peak position of each element.</li>
		<li>Use the “Qual” function and the dwell time and beam current chosen in step 2 to collect WDS spectra covering the spectral range from L = 5
		mm below to L = 5 mm above each element’s nominal peak position.</li>
		<li>Note the peak position, peak count rate, background count rate, and whether you can see a peak at all.  If you don’t see a peak at all, go
		back to step 2 and increase the dwell time/beam current.</li>
		<li>Calculate the standard deviations of the peak and background count rate (square root of the number of counts), and compare these to your
		personal criteria** for detection and quantification limits (how many BG standard deviations is the net count rate?  Greater than 3x?  10x?).  If
		the results are unacceptable, go back to step 2)</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p><b><u>*Note:</u></b> If the user is interested in mapping small compositional variations in major elements, it may be worth considering whether to
	include these in the optimization process.  However, this usually isn’t the case.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>**Note:</u></b> If the net peak count rate is 10 standard deviations above background, this would be considered by most people to reach the
	“Limit of Quantification.”  This is the criterion that I recommend using.</p>
	
	<h4>Part 2: Will we be able to see any zonation in the elements of interest?</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Use the “X-ray measure” tool to analyze a few points* on the map area (if applicable, set the beam diameter beforehand to match the size used
		in the map).</li>
		<li>Calculate the count rate** for each point by dividing the number of counts by the measurement time.</li>
		<li>Calculate the standard deviation at each point (square root of the number of counts), and compare these to your personal criteria for 
		detection and quantification limits (how much higher is the count rate from one point to another?  Greater than 3x?  10x?).  If the results are
		unacceptable, go back to step 2).</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>*Alternatively, a line analysis could also be done if time permits.</p>
	
	<p>**Note:  This approach assumes that the count rates aren’t time-dependent.  This can be assessed using the “Rate Meter” tool.</p>
	
	<h4>Part 3: Is the heterogeneity real or artificial?</h4>
	
	<p>At this point, you might have either a) used the “X-ray measure” tool to identify two locations that yield different X-ray count rates or b)
	collected your map and seen two areas with different count rates.  In either case, it’s still necessary to consider whether the differences in count
	rate are actually due to differences in the composition of the material as opposed to differences in the background count rate.  Here is how to make 
	this determination:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Collect WDS spectra from two locations on the sample for comparison.  Let’s call the regions with the lower and higher count rates “Location
		1” and “Location 2” respectively.</li>
		<li>Calculate the net count rate (peak minus background counts) for the two points.</li>
		<li>If the net count rate of Location 2 is greater than Location 1 by 3σ calculated for Location 1, then it’s safe to conclude that the
		heterogeneity is real.</li>
	</ol>
