	<h1>Elemental interferences</h1>
	
	<p>WDS detectors have much better energy resolution than EDS detectors, but elemental interferences still occur.  For example, here are some examples
	of "classic" interferences:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Ti K-lines vs Ba L-lines</li>
		<li>V Ka vs Ti Kb</li>
		<li>Rb L-lines vs Si K-alpha</li>
		<li>S Ka vs Mo L-?</li>
		<li>Second-order Fe line vs F?</li>
		<li>Transition metal K-alpha vs K-beta lines on PET?</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Identifying interferences</h3>
	
	<p>The most straightforward way to identify elemental interferences is by comparing WDS spectra that contain peaks of the element of interest and
	interfering element.  Do the peaks overlap with each other or get in the way of suitable background spot locations?  If so, then you have identified
	an elemental interference... but is the interference going to be significant for your analysis?</p>
	
	<h3>Assessing the significance of elemental interferences</h3>
	
	<p>When you use JEOL's WDS spectral analysis program, you will see that there are X-rays everywhere!  For example, you may see that the Pb M-beta
	line you want to analyze overlaps with a Y L-gamma line, a La line, and a higher order (?) S line.  But L-lines and higher-order lines are generally
	pretty weak.  Are they likely to contribute enough counts to affect the measured net count rates you care about?  A good way to figure this out is
	to use the equation described in <a href = "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/891/1/012001">Allaz et al., 2020</a>:</p>
	
	<p>%_interference = (I_A_interf/I_A_std)*(C_A_std/C_B_interf)*(C_B_unk/C_A_unk)</p>
	
	<p>...for element of interest "A" and interfering element "B" where...</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>I_A_interf = intensity at the peak position of element A in the interference standard,</li>
		<li>I_A_std = intensity at the peak position of element A in the calibration standard,</li>
		<li>C_A_std = concentration of element A in the calibration standard,</li>
		<li>C_B_interf = concentration of element B in the interference standard,</li>
		<li>C_A_std = concentration of element A in the unknown sample, and</li>
		<li>C_B_interf = concentration of element B in the unknown sample.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>To apply this equation, perform Qual analyses on both the calibration standard ("std") for element "A" and an interference standard ("interf")
	that contains a significan amount of interfering element "B" but none of element "A".  The value "I_A_interf" is determined by using the intensity
	measured from the "shoulder" of the peak for element "B" at the same L-value used to measure "I_A_std".  Allaz et al. propose that "%interference"
	of about 2% corresponds to a "minor" interference, and less than 0.5% corresponds to an "insignificant" interference.</p>

	<p>By inspecting this equation, it becomes apparent that elemental interferences are less significant when analyzing major elements and more significant
	for trace element analyses.  When "A" is a major element, "C_B_unk" is likely to be very small relative to "C_A_unk" for most elements, so the ratio
	"%_interference" will be close to zero.  While major elements by definition only vary within 1 order of magnitude (10 wt% to 100 wt%), the concentrations
	of trace elements detectable by the microprobe can vary from 10 ppm to 10,000 ppm (1 wt%), so the ratio "C_B_unk/C_A_unk" can potentially vary over
	seven orders of magnitude (from [1E+4 ppm / 1E+1 ppm] = 1E+3 to [1E+1 ppm / 1E+4 ppm] = 1E-3).
	
	<h3>Countermeasures for interferences</h3>
	
	<p>What is one to do if "%interf" is a few percent or larger?  Here are a few general options:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b><u>Use different hardware:</u></b> Using WDS instead of EDS already provides a dramatic improvement in energy resolution, but interferences
		can still -- especially for trace elements as discussed above.  Another example of an alternative hardware configuration is performing analyses
		at a longer focal length where peaks are better resolved.  For example, the Ti vs Ba interference can be mitigated by using a LiF crystal instead
		of a PET crystal because the overlapping peaks occur at around 192 mm on the LiF crystal vs about 89 mm on the PET crystal.  Another "hardware
		option" is to reduce the slit width on the spectrometer -- this should (?) reduce the count rate but also make the peaks more narrow and increase
		the signal/noise ratio.  Finally, if you have the funding, you could upgrade to a spectrometer with a larger Rowland circle -- that should also
		work, right?</li>
		<li><b><u>Use different peaks:</u></b> This is probably obvious enough to go without saying, but one can potentially avoid an elemental interference
		by switching to a different X-ray.  If the Ka line for element A doesn't work, then try the Kb line or the second order Ka line.</li>
		<li><b><u>Use different detector settings:</u></b> If the interfering peak from element B is a higher order line, then it can be filtered out by
		adjusting the window on the detector to exclude lower voltage pulses which correspond to lower energy X-rays.</li>
		<li><b><u>Spectral deconvolution:</u></b> This is what is done on the EDS, but it's not likely to be a practical option in most cases for the WDS
		because of the amount of time required to collect WDS spectra.  It's a legit option though, so I include it for completeness.  This can be done
		either by fitting a gaussian curve (the X-axis should be energy -- not L-value!) or by using a spectrum without the interference as a "peak shape"
		reference with MLLSQ fitting as in DTSA-II.</li>
		<li><b><u>Correction factors:</u></b> Basically use the ratio "(I_A_interf/I_A_std)*(C_A_std/C_B_interf)" to correct the measured concentration of
		element "A" from a quant analysis.  To do this the "lazy way" one would just multiply the ratio by the concentration of element "B" and subtract
		the result from element "A" but this would not account for matrix effects.  A better approach is to apply the interference factor to the measured
		net count rate and then apply the necessary matrix corrections.  This approach is described in more detail below.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Interference correction factors in JEOL's software</h3>
	
	<p>JEOL's PC-EPMA program allows the user to correct the net count rate of an element "A" of interest using a correction factor multiplied by the
	net count rate multiplied by the net count rate of interfering element "B".  Note that both elements need to be analyzed using WDS -- not EDS.
	This is controlled using the table in the purple "analysis condition" field to specify spectrometer/crystal/element A, spectrometer/crystal/element B,
	and a constant "ratio" value.  Here are the steps to determine the ratio:
	
	<ol>
		<li>Calibrate a quantitative analysis using normal standards for both elements "A" and "B"</li>
		<li>Perform Quant analyses on the reference materials used to calibrate elements "A" and "B" without any interference correction.</li>
		<li>Calculate the ratio by dividing the count rate of "element A" analysed in the standard for element B (i.e. "I_A_interf") by the count rate of
		element "A" in the standard for element "A".</li>
		<li>Use the "OffQnt" tool to reprocess the quantitative analysis of "standard A" using the interference correction "ratio" obtained in step 3.
		Increase the "ratio" value if the corrected count rate is greater than zero (undercorrecting), or decrease the "ratio" if the corrected count rate
		is less than zero (overcorrecting).</li>
		<li>Update the quantitative analysis recipe to apply the ratio.</li>
	</ol>
