	<h1>Quant mapping</h1>
    
	<p><i>Rev. 7/16/2024 LRM</i></p>
	
	<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> To date, I am not aware of a case in which a quant map is necessary to answer a scientific question.  My opinion that a minimum
	amount of time should be spent on quant mapping.</p>
	
	<p>Quant mapping refers to a process of collecting and post-processing X-ray maps so that they display the concentration of each element in the
	material rather than just the count rate.  This can be done in one of several ways:</p>
	
	<h4>Empirical quant map</h4>
	
	<p>A few points in the map are analyzed using WDS or WDS, and then a multi-point calibration curve is used to convert the pixel values from raw
	counts to concentration.</p>
	
	<p><i><u>Pros:</u></i> Quick and easy to do.  Easy to explain what you did.</p>
	<p><i><u>Cons:</u></i> Pixel compositions can be wildly inaccurate if the mapped area contains multiple phases with different densities (not the case
	in this sample).</p>
	
	<h4>Background-corrected empirical quant map (a.k.a. “Castaing map”)</h4>
	
	<p>The background count value is estimated using a simultaneously-collected BSE map, count maps are converted into net count maps by subtracting
	the background value at each pixel, and then a calibration curve is used as in the Empirical quant map.</p>
	
	<p><i><u>Pros:</u></i> Basically just as fast as empirical quant maps, but more accurate.  Better for samples with multiple phases with different densities.</p>
	<p><i><u>Cons:</u></i> Still can be inaccurate – especially when multiple phases are present with different densities.  Figuring out how to estimate the
	background using BSE images is a little tricky.</p>
	
	<h4>JEOL quant map:</h4>
	
	<p>Peak and background maps are collected for each pixel, a standard reference material is used to calibrate the net count rate obtained for each
	pixel into a concentration, and then matrix effect (e.g. ZAF) corrections are performed at each pixel.</p>
	<p><i><u>Pros:</u></i> Pixels are as accurate as quantitative point analyses.  They’re not as precise individually but the average compositions of many
	pixels can be more precise than individual point analyses, depending on the count times used.  “Totals” map provides excellent quality control.</p>
	<p><i><u>Cons:</u></i> Takes forever to collect using our software (often 6 times longer depending on the number of elements being analyzed). All elements
	must be present to provide a complete composition.</p>
	
	<h4>MAN-based quant map:</h4>
	
	<p>In principle, the user doesn't actually need to collect background maps because the background count rate can be predicted based on the
	composition -- specifically the mean atomic number (MAN) of the sample.  In this approach, as described by <a href = "https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2021-7739">
	Donovan et al. (2021)</a>, the user collects peak maps and then iteratively uses these to determine the composition of the sample using an empirical
	relationship to estimate the background at each spectrometer position based on the calculated mean atomic number of the sample.  The setup for this
	method involves analyzing several pure metal standards (i.e. with known atomic numbers) to determine the background count rate at the spectrometer
	positions where elements of interest will eventually be analyzed.</p>
	
	<p><i><u>Pros:</u></i> Fast, accurate, and more precise than JEOL quant maps because additional analytical uncertainty is not incurred by background maps.</p>
	<p><i><u>Cons:</u></i> We don't have the necessary software to do this, and somebody will need to figure out the method!</p>
