	<h1>WDS calibration standards analysis</h1>
    
	<p><i>Rev. 5/29/2023 LRM</i></p>
	
	<p><u>Note</u>: This SOP describes how to analyze reference materials to calibrate an existing WDS quantitative analysis recipe.  Creating the quant
	analysis recipe first isn’t strictly necessary, but I think it’s a good idea for organizational/training purposes.</p>
	
	<p><u>Note</u>: Make sure that the spectrometer configuration (orange section) and accelerating voltage (green section) match the quant recipe that you’re
	calibrating.  I’ve gotten this wrong more times than I should admit.</p>
	
	<p><b>To get started</b>, click the “Quick” button in the “PC-EPMA” program on the right side monitor, select the “Common recipe” button, and double click
	the “New Standard Analysis” recipe on the list to the right.</p>
	
	<h3>Gray/Green menus: File path/beam conditions</h3>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Set the “Path” field to the main folder on the E: drive where the data will be stored</li>
		<li>Set the “Project Name” field according to the analyses being done (this creates a subfolder in the “Path” directory when data are generated)</li>
		<li>Input/read the beam conditions (voltage/current).  Note that the checkboxes control whether the instrument will set the beam conditions
		automatically or use the existing conditions.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Purple section: Standard analysis condition</h3>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Check “detail” box to view the detailed settings for this section</li>
		<li>Click the “...” button to choose the standard, use “Move” button if using a stored position, and click “Ok”</li>
		<li>Choose asynchronous mode</li>
		<li>Check to confirm that these settings are used:
			<ul>
				<li>Peak search once every 10 points (so it will search once before the analysis of the first point)</li>
				<li>Background “Always” (so it will look at the background every time)</li>
				<li>Read probe current “Always” (so it will read the probe current before each analysis)</li>
			</ul>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Yellow section: analysis position condition</h3>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Check “detail” box</li>
		<li>Move to a fresh location on the standard, focus on the sample surface using the OM image, and click the “Read position” button</li>
		<li>If you’ll be navigating using the OM image, click the rectangle button to “pop out” the OM monitor window (this needs to be done
		because of a software bug)</li>
		<li>Click the “...” button to open the “Multiple accumulation” window</li>
		<li>Move to a few more random locations and store them the “Add or change” button (usually I do four replicates total)</li>
		<li>Set the beam scanning condition (e.g. circle with 5 micron diameter)</li>
		<li>Click the “apply” button, and double check that everything looks correct</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Orange section: Analysis element condition</h3>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Check the “detail” box</li>
		<li>Click the periodic table button (“element” tab should be selected instead of the “search” tab)</li>
		<li>Click the elements which will be calibrated with this standard.</li>
		<li>For each element:
			<ul>
				<li>Default PHA settings</li>
				<li>Peak search: #1 (may be necessary to use #2 for L- and M-lines, or other hard-to-locate trace element peaks)</li>
				<li>Set the count time and background point spacing (e.g. 5mm means to use an L-value 5 mm below/above the peak position as background</li>
			</ul>
	</ol>
	
	<p><u>Note</u>: The analysis can be started by clicking the “Acquire” button, but since you will probably analyzing a bunch of standards, it usually
	makes more sense to click “add to serial analysis” instead. To start the chain of queued serial analyses, go to the “Serial Analysis” tab at
	the bottom of the EPMA software window, and click “Start”</p>
