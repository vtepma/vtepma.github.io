	<h1>WDS quantitative analyses (existing recipe)</h1>
    
	<p><i>Rev. 4/18/2024 LRM</i></p>

	<p><u>Note</u>: This SOP describes how to use a pre-calibrated “recipe” which has been calibrated in advance.  For information about calibrating Quant
	analyses, see the “Quant setup” SOP.</p>

	<ol type = "1">
		<li>Click on the “<b>Quick</b>” tab in the PC-EPMA window (right side monitor), and double click on the User Recipe corresponding to the type of
		quantitative analysis you intend to do.</li>
		<li>Update the folder name and directory.</li>
		<li>In the yellow “sample locations” section for each sample location:
			<br><br>
			<u>Note</u>: It’s a good practice to add to the list of points for each acquisition rather than deleting the locations of previously-analyzed points.
			You can simply uncheck points that you don’t want to analyze, and they will be omitted from the acquisition by the software.
			<br><br>
			<ol type = "a">
				<li>Select the next row in the list, and enter a comment to identify the sample</li>
				<li>Move to the correct location, and adjust the OM focus (stage Z-axis position)
				<br><br>
				<u>Note</u>: always end on a clockwise turn and press the “Jog” button
				<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>Click the “<b>Read</b>” button to retrieve the sample location from the current stage coordinates</li>
				<li>Set the correct beam conditions (e.g. a circular spot, 5 micron diameter)</li>
				<li>Click the “<b>Apply</b>” button, and double check that the information was stored correctly in the table.</li>
			</ol>
		<br>
		</li>
		<li>When you’re ready to start the analyses, note the calculated duration, <b>Save the recipe</b>, and click the “<b>Acquire</b>” button</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>To retrieve the data:</h3>
	
	<ol type = "1">
		<li>Click the “EPMA Data” tab at the bottom of the PC-EPMA window</li>
		<li>Click the “Refresh” button to update the file list to include all new data</li>
		<li>Click the folder containing your data. You should see one or several numbered files which each correspond to a single analytical result.</li>
		<li>Click the “Summary” button near the folder icons.</li>
		<li>In the menu that appears, click the “To Excel” button.  This will open the data in the Libre Calc spreadsheet program where data can be
		viewed and manipulated.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><u>Note</u>: Because the stage reproducibility in our system is imperfect, it is sometimes desirable to do analyses one at a time.  This results in many
	project folders which each contain a single analysis file.  To combine and export the data in this case, right click the parent directory and click
	the option to combine similar files.  This will send all of the analyses into the same directory and renumber them so they can be easily exported as
	a single table.</p>
