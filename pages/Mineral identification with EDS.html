	<h1>Lowell's 3 1/2 methods for identifying minerals using EDS</h1>
    
	<ol>
		<li><b><u>The Reed Book:</u></b> If you look in the appendices at the end of "the Reed Book," you'll find many examples of EDS spectra collected
		from common minerals.  Collect a point spectrum from your mystery mineral and try to match it with one of these example spectra.</li>
		<li><b><u>The DHZ Book:</u></b> The mineralogy textbook(s) by Deer Howie and Zussman (DHZ) include many examples of bulk compositions of minerals.
		Collect a standardless EDS analysis (or WDS analysis) of your mystery mineral and try to match the composition with one of these compositions.</li>
		<li><b><u>Calculate a mineral formula:</u></b> Once you have used one or both of the two methods above to obtain a "candidate mineral" that your
		mystery mineral could be, look up the mineral formula to find the number of O atoms, and calculate the number of cations from your oxide composition.
		This doesn't apply to minerals without O (pyrite, etc).</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>...or you can just query Google or ChatGPT with a question of the form "what is a mineral containing elements A, B, and C that commonly occurs
	in rock type X?"  Sometimes you'll get lucky and the answer won't be too inaccurate.</p>
