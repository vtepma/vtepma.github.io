	<h1>Estimating quantitative detection limits</h1>
	
	<p></i>Rev. 1/29/2025 LRM</i><p>
    
	<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> more information about this subject can be found in section 8.5 in "the Reed book" starting on page 142,
	and also in my lecture about uncertainty.</p>
	
	<p>The easiest and most straightforward option for assessing detection limits is to just perform a standardless quantitative
	analysis on the sample of interest.  With this approach, you can experiment with different beam currents and count times without
	needing to perform a full calibration.  This could also be done using the "X-ray measure" tool, but that approach introduces more
	opportunities for user error although it is sometimes more beneficial as a pedagogical approach.</p>
	
	<p>Here's the process for assessing uncertainties and detection limits using the standardless analysis method:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Analyse the material of interest using the EDS detector to identify which elements are present, and at what concentrations.</li>
		<li>Set up a quantitative analysis recipe for the material including the major elements identified using EDS and the trace
		elements of interest, and leave the calibration stantard as "Cal-Std".</li>
		<li>Analyze the material of interest using the standardless WDS recipe.</li>
		<li>Open the quantitative analysis result returned as a ".wt" file, and note the following values:
			<ul>
				<li>"Net(cps)": This is the current-normalized net count rate above background.</li>
				<li>"Bg-" and "Bg+": These are the current-normalized background count rates.</li>
				<li>"S.D.(%)": This is the relative standard deviation of the analysis determined based on counting statistics.</li>
				<li>"D.L.(ppm)": This is the detection limit calculated from counting statistics defined as three standard deviations above
				background.</li>
			</ul>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Now consider this: it is commonly accepted that an analyte is "detectable" if its signal is 3 standard deviations above a background signal
	(usually determined by analyzing a blank that is presumed to contain none of the analyte).  Similarly the concentration of the analyte is
	considered to be "quantifiable" if its signal is 10 standard deviations above background.  This is based on the statistical definitions of
	"false positive" and "false negative" errors.  While I don't generally advocate the use of statistics, I do think these concepts are useful
	for quantitative analyses (and mapping) because they do tend to conform to most users expectations regarding data quality.</p>
	
	<p>Calculating the number of standard deviation above background is fairly straightforward: just convert the count rates to the "raw" number
	of counts by multiplying by the count times, take the square root of the mean of both background count values -- that gives you the standard
	deviation of the background count rate -- and then divide the net count value by this number.  If the result is greater than 3, then the element
	is detectable.  If it's greater than 10, then the element is quantifiable.</p>
	
	<p>This ratio of the net counts to the standard deviation of the backgrount counts is the <b>signal-to-noise ratio</b>.  It can be improved
	by making the following changes to your analysis recipe:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Increase the beam current</li>
		<li>Increase the count time (note that for trace elements both background count times should approach the peak count time)</li>
		<li>Increase the accelerating voltage (is the overvoltage ratio sufficiently high for the X-ray you're trying to excite?)</li>
	</ul>
