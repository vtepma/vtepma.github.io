	<h1>Detector optimization</h1>
    
	<p>Have you ever selected the "Default" setting under the "PHA settings" when you are setting up a recipe involving the WDS detectors and wondered
	what these settings refer to?  If so, you're about to learn what those settings are all about.</p>
	
	<p>Our WDS detectors work on two basic principles: the first is Bragg diffraction, and the second is that of gaseous ionization detection.  This
	second principle is what makes a Geiger counter work.  Geiger counters rely on the same kind of detector that our WD spectrometers use, which is
	a tube of inert gas with a wire running through it.  The wire is has a high voltage (~1600 V) relative to the tube, and when when an ionizing particle
	or X-ray passes through it, the gas becomes ionized in a process called a "Townsend avalanche" so that current can flow between the wire and the
	tube.  This creates an electrical pulse that is converted to a "click" in the case of a Geiger counter and is converted into an X-ray count by
	the microprobe.</p>
	
	<p>(This is where a schematic illustration of an X-ray detector should go.  Such an illustration can be found on p. 94 in "the Reed book")</p>
	
	<p>After an electrical signal is produced by the tube, the signal is read by a piece of hardware called the "pulse processor" which is responsible
	for descriminating between X-ray counts that we care about (e.g. characteristic X-rays that your recipe is calibrated to turn into elemental
	concentrations), X-ray counts that we don't care about (e.g. Ar escape peaks, higher order X-rays), and electrical noise (e.g. electrical interference
	from the spectrometer motors).  It turns out that our X-ray detectors are sort of like little EDS detectors in the sense that the voltage of the
	electrical signals produced by the detector are correlated with the type of signal or energy of incoming X-rays (in fact, SDDs like the one used
	in our EDS detector have been used as a replacement for gas proportional counters on <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1093/micmic/ozad067.420">some
	experimental microprobes</a>).  For this reason, these signals can be discriminated by setting a lower limit or optional upper limit to the voltages
	accepted by the pulse processor.  A histogram of the voltage amplitude (?) or "pulse height" versus the number of pulses (analogous to an EDS spectrum)
	is used in pulse-height analysis (PHA) to decide where to set upper and lower voltage limits.</p>
	
	<p>(This is where a schematic illustration of a pulse height distribution would go. Such an illustration can  be found on p. 96 in "the Reed book")</p>
	
	<p>Our X-ray detectors can be "tuned" for optimal performance by changing the following variables:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li><u>High voltage (HV)</u> -- this is the voltage between the wire and the tube.</li>
		<li><u>Base level</u> -- this is the lower limit of the allowed voltage range.  This is usually set below main voltage peak but above the low
		voltage noise level</li>
		<li><u>Window</u> -- this is the optional upper voltage limit.  In principle, it could be used to exclude a higher-energy X-ray.</li>
		<li><u>Detector mode</u> -- "Differential" and "integral" modes refer to whether or not the window parameter is used respectively (i.e. there
		is no upper voltage limit when "integral" mode is used.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The goal of "tuning the detectors" is to maximize the count rate of desirable X-rays and minimize the count rate of undesirable X-rays or "counts"
	that can be attributed to electrical noise.  Here is the basic process for "tuning" a detector for a particular X-ray:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Choose an element, X-ray, calibration standard, spectrometer, and accelerating voltage appropriate for the analysis for which you are optimizing
		the detector.</li>
		<li>Change the beam diameter to 10 microns -- this will limit damage to the standard as a lot of time will be spent with the beam focused on
		one spot.</li>
		<li>Move to the nominal peak position for the element, and set the beam current so that you are getting about 10,000 counts per second.</li>
		<li>Perform a peak search and leave the spectrometer on the new peak position.</li>
		<li>Open the "PHA" tab at the bottom of the "PC-EPMA" window.</li>
		<li>Select the HV scan tab, and perform a high voltage scan.  Similar to a peak search, the software should now set the detector to the optimal
		voltage that yielded the maximum number of counts.</li>
		<li>Select the "Base level" tab, and click the start button to run a base level scan.</li>
		<li>Adjust the base level and window values to exclude the noise peak and any other unwanted peaks (escape peak, higher order X-rays)</li>
		<li>Note the HV, base level, window, and detector mode settings.  The only values saved by the software are whatever you save in your recipe
		and the default values.</li>
		<li>You're all done!  Don't forget to change the beam diameter back to "0 microns"</li>
	</ol>
