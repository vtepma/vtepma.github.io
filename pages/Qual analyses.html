	<h1>WDS spectra (a.k.a. Qualitative/"Qual" analyses)</h1>
	
	<p><i>Rev. 8/13/2024 LRM</i></p>
    
	<p>The microprobe has two types of X-ray spectrometers: one energy distpersive spectrometer (EDS) and five wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS).
	These basically both collect spectra in the same way -- by sweeping through their allowed energy range to assign X-ray counts to a particular energy
	level.  However the EDS detector performs this "sweeping" operation many orders faster than the WDS detector (microseconds vs tens to thousands of seconds).
	For this reason, I usually tell users that the EDS detecor can collect the full energy range suimultaneously while the WDS can only "look at one energy
	at a time" -- this is a lie in the sense that the EDS spectrum is collected one channel at a time rather than with all channels collected simultaneously.</p>
	
	<p>(This is where I should put some kind of WDS schematic.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure where to refer the reader for an existing schematic at the time
	of writing.)</p>
	
	<p>Qualitative analysis (or the acquisition of WDS spectra) is done by dosing a single location with electrons (analyzing one spot) while scanning one
	or several of the WDS detectors through a specified range corresponding to different X-ray energies.  These are the factors that must be considered
	to set up a Qual analysis:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b><u>Spectrometer range:</u></b> the start and end spectrometer position in terms of the spectrometer length ("L-value" = sample-detector
		distance in mm)</li>
		<li><b><u>Step size:</u></b> the spectrometer length of one channel in the spectrum (the number of channels = spectrometer range / step size)</li>
		<li><b><u>Dwell time:</u></b> the amount of time to be spent counting on each channel (the acquisition time = number of channels * dwell time)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Why WDS spectra?</h3>
	
	<p>WDS spectra aren't particularly useful for calculating quantitative elemental concentrations or determining the distribution of elements within the
	sample.  However, they're extremely useful for method development tasks like these:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Deciding where to put your background points for quant analysis (look at representative WDS spectra of materials with the elements of
		interest -- or potentially interfering elements -- to find "clean" background areas to use).</li>
		<li>Determinig the beam conditions are needed to detect an element of interest in a quantitative analysis or a map (collect a WDS spectrum
		of your sample and use the peak and background intensities to figure out what your detection limits are).</li>
		<li>Locating the optimum L-value to use for the maximum count rate (i.e. to be "on peak"; collect a WDS spectrom of a narrow region
		about the peak to locate the maximum).  You probably do this all the time -- it's called a "peak search".</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b><u>Fun fact:</u></b> WDS spectra run in the opposite direction of EDS spectra (L-value increases with decreasing energy).  However, if you change
	the X-axis to keV in the software, it will reverse the axis for you.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Fun fact:</u></b> While JEOL microprobes report the spectrometer length as the L-value in mm, Cameca probes report the spectrometer position
	in terms of "sin theta units" which are just 100,0000x the value of sin(theta) as in Bragg's law.  The JEOL units make more sense if you want to think
	about your analysis in terms of what is physically going on with regard to the spectrometer geometry relative to your sample.  The Cameca units make
	more sense if you want to think about your analysis in terms of what is going on in relation to the diffraction crystal.</p>
	
	<h3>WDS spectra and trace elements</h3>
	
	<p>What happens if we want to see a trace element peak in a WDS spectrum?  Trace elements can be detected on the microprobe by using long count times
	spent counting on a very narrow energy range, but this means that collecting a representative WDS spectrom takes a very long time.  Consider the following
	example.  To analyze Pb in monazite, we need to count on peak and background points for 200 s each -- this corresponds to a 600 s acquisition time
	(10 minutes).  However, if we want to collect a WDS spectrum that shows the Pb peak (0.01 s of wt%) we would need to use the same count time from the
	quant recipe as our dwell time.  If we collect our spectrum so that it includes both background points with a +5/-5 mm offset, we would need to scan
	over 10 mm.  With a 100 micron step length, this would be 10 mm / (0.1 mm/channel) = 100 channels.  With a dwell time of 200 s, the total acquisition
	time for the WDS spectrum would be 20,000 s, or 5.56 hours.</p>
	
	<p>This is not just a problem because the user will get bored -- leaving a static beam on the sample for this long would certainly damage the sample.
	The long duration can't be avoided, but the beam damage issue can simply be resolved by dividing the analysis into many acquisitions so that the final
	WDS spectrum is calculated as the average of many shorter-duration spectra.  Dividing the total time by the duration of the quantitave analysis
	mentioned above, the number of acquisitions needed = 20,000 s / 600 s = 33ish acquisitions.</p>
	
	<p>So to summarize, here is the process to set up a WDS spectrum for trace element analysis:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>First, determine an acceptable amount of time for the analysis.  It's a good idea to establish what your constraints are ahead of time!</li>
		<li>Determine the spectrometer range that is required.  Maybe 15 mm?  This is the default +5/-5 mm offset, plus 50% extra.</li>
		<li>Determine the required step size.  How many channels are required to see the peaks of interest?  Consider looking at some high-concentration
		elements that are near the trace element peaks of interest to determine this.</li>
		<li>Determine the count time that would be applicable for a quantitative analysis.  Do you expect that you will be counting for 10s on peak + 5s
		on BG?  Or 300s on peak + 300s on BG?</li>
		<li>Calculate the number of channels and the total Qual acquisition time using the long count time from the Quant analysis</li>
		<li>Divide the Qual acquisition time by the quant acquisition time to determine the number of Qual acquisitions that will be needed to see the
		peaks of interest.</li>
		<li>Set up the spectrometers in the Qual analysis (Orange section) by adjusting the dwell time such that the calculated acquisition time matched
		the acquisition time of the quantitative analysis.</li>
		<li>Set up the analysis position condition in the Qual analysis (Yellow section) for multiple accumulations using the "..." button for the
		calculated number of accumulations.  Use the same spot size as in the Quant analysis recipe.</li>
		<li>Set the beam condition in the Qual analysis (green section) to match the quantitative analysis.</li>
	</ol>
