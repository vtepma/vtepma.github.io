	<h1>Quant analysis workflow</h1>
    
	<p><i>Rev. 9/24/2024 LRM</i></p>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>This document summarizes the basic process for performing quant analyses on the microprobe as is often done by geologists.  This is the general process:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Make a plan</li>
		<li>Create a quantitative analysis recipe</li>
		<li>Analyze standards to generate calibration files</li>
		<li>Validate your recipe</li>
		<li>Put in points and analyze your samples</li>
		<li>Quality control and postprocessing</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Make a plan</h3>
	
	<p>Before you do anything on the microprobe, it's a good idea to form a plan about how you want to perform your analyses.  This plan should include the
	following information:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>What are the questions that you hope to answer by collecting data on the microprobe?</li>
		<li>What material will you be analyzing?</li>
		<li>Which elements are you interested in, and roughly what concentrations are you expecting?</li>
		<li>What spectrometer configuration do you plan to use (which spectrometer/which element/which crystal)</li>
		<li>How long do you expect/need your analyses to take? (count times)</li>
		<li>What beam conditions do you plan to use? (Accelerating voltage, beam current, spot size)</li>
		<li>What reference materials do you plan to use to calibrate your recipe?</li>
		<li>How do you plan to analyze your standards? (Same or different conditions from unknowns?)</li>
		<li>What reference materials do you plan to use to validate your recipe?</li>
		<li>What metrics do you plan to use for quality control?</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Most of this information can be found by reviewing the literature to determine "what do other people do," but it is expected that few microprobe users
	will be prepared with all of this information in advance, so please ask the lab manager for help when preparing this plan!</p>
	
	<h3>Creating a quantitative analysis recipe</h3>
	
	<p>In our lab, we use JEOL's "PC-EPMA" program for data acquisition.  This program uses a "recipe" template to store all of the settings, or "Conditions"
	associated with the analyses that we do.  Setting up a recipe forces the user to finalize the plan so that it can be executed by the microprobe's
	automation software.</p>
	
	<p>Here is the SOP document for creating a new quantitative analysis recipe: <a href = "SOP -- WDS quantitative analyses -- new recipe.html">SOP -- WDS
	quantitative analyses -- new recipe</a></p>
	
	<h3>Analyze standards to generate calibration files</h3>
	
	<p>When you are setting up your quantitative analysis recipe, if you examine one of your elements in the orange "Analysis Element Condition" section,
	you will see that the "Standard" field says "Cal-Std" by default.  This is where you specify which standard file is used to relate the X-ray count rate
	obtained during the analysis to an elemental/oxide concentration.  The "Cal-Std" setting refers to a factory-calibrated, or "standardless", analysis mode
	which can be used to perform analyses without doing any calibrations in advance -- this is a great tool for training users, testing out/debugging new
	recipes, and the results are usually not too terrible (accurate to within a few wt%).  When we calibrate the microprobe, we analyze a reference material
	with a known composition using a "Standard Analysis" recipe (as opposed to your "Quantitative Analysis" recipe).  This creates a standard analysis file
	that will be used instead of the default factory calibration.</p>
	
	<p>Here is the SOP document for doing calibrations: <a href = "SOP -- WDS calibration standards analysis.html">SOP -- WDS calibration standards analysis
	</a></p>
	
	<h3>Validate your recipe</h3>
	
	<p>Here is the SOP document for performing quantitative analyses using an existing recipe: <a href = "SOP -- WDS quantitative analyses -- existing recipe.html">SOP -- WDS quantitative analyses -- existing recipe</a></p>
	
	<p>At this point, you have a calibrated quantitative analysis recipe, and you <i>technically could</i> start putting in points and analyzing your samples.
	However, before you do this, you should take some time to analyze one or a few reference materials for which you know the correct composition to make
	sure that your recipe is giving you accurate results.  Also, this is when you will start to apply the <i>"metrics for quality control"</i> part of your
	analysis plan.  For example, some users like to see analyses with totals between 98.5 to 101.0 wt%, and individual
	element/oxide concentrations that are accurate to within 5 percent, relative.<p>
	
	<p>If you're not happy with the results, you probably made a mistake when running your standard analyses -- this happens all the time, and it is very easy
	for user error to occur during the calibration step.  Try re-doing any of the affected calibrations to see if things improve.  If they don't, ask the lab
	manager for assistance.</p>
	
	<p>If you are happy with the results, then you can go ahead and start analyzing your samples.</p>
	
	<h3>Put in points and analyze your samples</h3>
	
	<p>There isn't much to say about this step because how and where you analyze your sample depends on your unique research goals.  If you have any
	questions about this, the lab manager can help you.  Otherwise, have fun putting in points!</p>
	
	<p>...but wait! -- what are you planning to do <a href = "Drift prevention and correction.html">about instrumental drift</a>?  A good way to check and
	correct for instrumental drift is to periodically analyze one or a few reference materials to make sure that their measured compositions aren't changing
	over time.  I recommend analyzing these about once every hour or two.  That means that, if your analyses take about three minutes to run, then every 20th
	or 40th point in your acquisition sequence should be an analysis of a reference material.</P>
	
	<p>Ok, <i>now</i> you can have fun putting in your points.  Please don't hesitate to call or text the lab manager if you get stuck or have any questions.</p>
	
	<h3>Quality control and postprocessing</h3>
	
	<p>Did your data turn out ok?  Do you need to apply a drift correction?  Do you have questions about how to export your data?  The lab manager can help
	you with these questions.</p>
	
	<p>In general, it is recommended that you use the "Summary" button to export your data to a comma-separated text file (spreadsheet) and then save this
	spreadsheet in the folder corresponding to the acquisition that ran when you clicked "Acquire" or whatever the case may be.  For example, if the data
	are all saved in the folder "QNT_0001" then you should save your spreadsheet in that folder.</p>
	
	<p>After you have exported your data, you can transfer the data from the microprobe using either our FileZilla server (from which it will be automatically
	archived), or you can also use Google Remote Desktop to do this if you are using the microprobe remotely.<p>
