	<h1>Drift correction and prevention</h1>
    
	<p><i>Rev. LRM 8/22/2024</i></p>
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
	<p>When you analyze the composition of a reference material on the microprobe, the difference between the reference composition and the measured
	composition is called “error.”  Error is present in every analysis, and there are many sources of error – these can be categorized into two types:
	random error and systematic error.  One type of systematic error is time-dependent “drift” which occurs when the state of the microprobe changes over
	time.  Drift is mostly due to temperature changes, which cause the sample and spectrometer to change over time such that the alignment described by
	the Bragg equation is no longer present.</p>

	<h3>What can we do about drift?</h3>

	<p>Microprobe users can minimize errors due to drift by applying one or both of these two strategies: 1) drift prevention using analytical
	countermeasures, which change the way data are collected to minimize the impact of drift; or 2) drift correction by measuring replicates of a reference
	composition and correcting the results for drift.</p>
	
	<h4>Option 1: drift-prevention countermeasures</h4>
	
	<p>JEOL’s “PC-EPMA” program has two software functions that can be used to periodically readjust the analysis recipe to accommodate instrument drift:
	a) automatic peak searches and b) OM autofocusing.</p>
	
	<p>Automatic peak searches minimize spectrometer drift by periodically realigning the spectrometer to the X-ray(s) used for the analyses.  To enable
	automatic peak searches:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Load the analysis recipe</li>
		<li>Check the “Detail” box for the purple “Quantitative analysis condition” section</li>
		<li>Change “Peak search of samples” to “Always” or “Every,” setting the frequency as appropriate.  For example, if “Every” is selected and set to 4,
		peak searches will be performed on analysis numbers 1, 5, 9, 13…</li>
		<li>Go to the “Detail” view of the orange “Analysis element condition” section</li>
		<li>Set peak search from “0: Skip” to “1: Narrow” for each element as necessary.  For example, Si is usually the element most affected by drift
		during analyses of Si minerals, and it is always present in the sample at high concentrations.  As such, this is a good element for automatic peak
		searches while others might not be appropriate.</li>
		<li>Save the recipe, and start acquiring data.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>OM autofocusing minimizes drift by automatically focusing the stage Z-height for individual samples before each analysis.  To enable OM autofocusing:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Load the analysis recipe</li>
		<li>Check the “Detail” box for the yellow “Analysis position condition” section</li>
		<li>For each analysis, check the box for “OM Auto Focus.”  To enable this for many analyses at once, click the “Property” button on the right side
		of the yellow section and follow the prompts.</li>
		<li>Save the recipe, and start acquiring data.</li>
		<li></li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Option 2: drift-correction</h4>
	
	<p>Alternatively, one can correct for drift by periodically analyzing replicates of a reference material and then calculating a time-dependent
	correction factor for one or several elements and then using this time-dependent correction factor to correct analyses of unknown materials.
	Additionally, we have an external data logger that can be used to monitor the room climate (temperature, pressure, relative humidity) to assist with
	these calculations.</p>

	<p>Here’s the process I would recommend:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Note the date and time.</li>
		<li>Start the green datalogger on the cart to the left of the column console:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Check that there is an SD card in the datalogger</li>
			<li>Press and hold the “Log” button until you hear a beep and see "datalogger" appear on the screen.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<li>Prepare your quantitative analysis recipe and make sure to include analyses of a reference material (e.g. MAC Diopside) once every hour or so.</li>
		<li>Collect data as normal.</li>
		<li>When data collection is finished, stop the datalogger and retrieve the data:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>press and hold the “Log” button on the datalogger to stop recording</li>
			<li>Remove the SD card and copy the data onto your computer</li>
			<li>Replace the SD card in the logger</li>
		</ul>
		
		<li>Talk to the lab manager about how to process the data, or you can do it yourself:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Make a plot of major elements in the reference materials vs temperature (or pressure, or humidity).  Is there a correlation?</li>
			<li>Re-plot the data for each major element as k = correct/measured, fit a line to this correlation.  Now you can calculate a correction
			factor as a function of temperature (or pressure, or humidity).</li>
			<li>Multiply this correction factor by your unknowns.  Did this “flatten out” any drift-related variation?  If so, pat yourself on the back,
			and go drink a beer!</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	
	<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> Correcting for drift in this way (i.e. by correcting elemental/oxide concentrations directly) is not completely rigorous because
	the corrected values will not have been re-corrected for matrix effects, and a more rigorous approach would be to drift correct the raw count rates (or
	K-ratios, as is done in the "Probe for EPMA" program) and then apply the matrix effect correction to the drift-corrected signal.  While my proposed
	method of drift correction does incur this additional source of inaccuracy, it is unlikely to be significant compared to other sources of error -- at
	least in the case of a standard set of "major elements" analyzed for petrological purposes.  This may not be the case for trace and light element analyses
	though.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> In theory, WDS quantitative analysis are superior to EDS analysis both in terms of precision and signl-to-noise ratios.  However, a
	major drawback of WDS detectors compared to modern SDD-EDS detectors is their susceptability to drift due to changes in room climate.  For example,
	rumor has it that even the heat generated by display monitors on the Control PC can influence count rates.  In the past, I believed that drift was
	only significant on days when hot weather or afternoon thunderstorms overwhelmed the puny HVAC system at the NCFL.  However, it is becoming more
	clear that drift can occur even on good days when the temperature stays between about 22 to 23 deg. C and temperature fluctions are within the 0.5
	deg. C per hour facility specification stated by JEOL.  For example, I've found that only about a 0.5 deg. C change in temperature translates into
	about a 1 wt% change in the measured SiO2 concentration in our MAC Diopside reference material.  This means that on a typical day, we could easily
	have our room temperature stay within spec but have totals that go outside a desirable range of 99.0 to 101.0 wt%.</p>
