	<h1>Image segmentation and visualization</h1>
    
	<p><i>Rev. 7/16/2024 LRM</i></p>
	
	<p>"Segmentation" refers to the process of labeling individual pixels in an image.  For example, suppose you are interested in producing a phase map
	that shows the itentity of each mineral present in the field of view.  To obtain this data product, you would need to use some kind of image
	segmentation strategy, such as the application of a clustering algorithm to identify each set of pixels that corresponds to each of the phases present
	in the sample.  Some of the available options for image segmentation are listed below:</p>
	
	<h2>Visualization options</h2>
	
	<p>To date, I have not encountered a use case in which image segmentation is needed to solve a scientific question.  For example,
	if you want to know the modal abundance of phases present in your rock, just try point counting (or using a basic script to rapidly perform
	a computer-assisted point count on a digital image).  However, having a basic strategy to visualize stacks of many X-ray maps is extremely helpful
	to most users.  Below I also list some "visualization options" that will help you segment the images in your brain -- the most useful of learning
	machines.</p>
	
	<h3>False color images</h3>
	
	<p>For today's microprobe users, an X-ray map is an array of numbers with coordinates correspoinding to their location relative to the sample and
	values corresponding to the net count rate.  When this map is displayed as a grayscale image on a computer screen, the software producing the image
	uses a table of color values to convert the numbers in the array into a corresponding shade of gray.  We could say the software "looks up" the
	appropriate color in the table, and these lists of colors are commonly referred to as "lookup tables" (LUTs).</p>
	
	<p>Our eyes/brains are very good at noticing slight differences in color, so it is often useful to use a lookup table that includes a range of colors
	to create colorful "false color" images.  For example, Pete's "JEOLMapExporter" program allows the user to choose between grayscale, rainbow, and
	"heat map" styled lookup tables.</p>
	
	<p>Instructions for creating false color images using ImageJ can be found in "Lowell's ImageJ notes".  I've reproduced them here in brief:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Open your TIFF-formatted image in ImageJ.  You can also start with an image that is not a TIFF, and convert it to a usable format with
		"Image > Type > 8-bit"</li>
		<li>Click "Image > Lookup Tables > Fire"</li>
		<li>Profit</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>RGB images</h3>
	
	<p>Suppose you have lots of X-ray maps of the same area and you want to make a simple image that captures what is going on in multiple channels.
	The simplest way to do this is to make an RGB image.  Here are some basic steps to make an RGB image in ImageJ:</p>\
	
	<ol>
		<li>Open three TIFF-formatted X-ray maps in ImageJ.  You can also do this with images imported as "text images".</li>
		<li>Optional: convert the images to 8-bit and/or adjust the brightness and contrast -- sometimes this helps ("Image > Type > 8-bit"; "Image
		> Adjust > Brightness/Contrast".</li>
		<li>Convert the images into a stack with "Image > Stacks > Tools > Concatenate..." -- this will give you the option to ultimately choose the
		order of the images in the stack, which will be mapped to the red, green, and blue channels in that order.</li>
		<li>Select "Image > Color > Stack to RGB..." to convert the stack into an RGB image.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>PCA images</h3>
	
	<p>RGB images have the advantage of being easy to create and easy to explain, but they have the disadvantage that they can only incorporate data from
	three channels.  Images can be made to incorporate more information if principle component analysis (PCA) is used to calculate the first three most
	significant principle components (PCs) and then assign these three PCs to the red, green, and blue color channels.  PCA images contain much more
	information than RGB images, but they are more complicated to create and the images are more difficult to interpret and explain.</p>
	
	<h2>Segmentation methods</h2>
	
	<h3>Just use the BSE image</h3> 
	
	<p>The most basic way to segment a map is to assign segments using threshold values for a single image.  It turns out that modern backscattered electron
	(BSE) images are so sensitive that you can usually identify the minerals in your sample using BSE images alone.  I recommend doing this in ImageJ:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Open the image, ideally a TIFF.</li>
		<li>Click "Image > Adjust > Threshold...</li>
		<li>Use the sliding bars to adjust the minimum and maximum range to be accepted/rejected.  The pixels that are within/outside the range are shown
		in red, and the area percentage of the selected pixels is displayed in the menu above the sliders.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Using this method, you can manually measure the area percentage of different materials in the sample.  Note that something similar can be done on
	RGB images using "Image > Adjust > Color threshold..."</p>
	
	<h3>JEOL "one click" high speed cluster analysis (HSCA)</h3>
	
	<p>Our microprobe comes with software for performing heirarchical cluster analyses on X-ray maps collected on the WDS detectors (note that EDS maps
	can't be used by this program).  Heirarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is done by calculating the Euclidean distance in compositional space (or I guess
	X-ray count rate space) between each pair of pixels and then sorting the pixels into groups based on their distance from other pixels (i.e. pixels with
	a similar composition are close together; pixels with different compositions are far apart).</p>
	
	<p>Here is how to create a phase map using JEOL's HSCA program:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Collect a map using the WDS detectors to analyze each element that will be used by the segmentation model.  Note that not all elements present
		in the sample need to be analyzed -- just those that vary in a way that is useful for the segmentation process.  For example, if the Si concentration
		is the same in all of the phases or only present in tiny accessory phases, then you don't need to analyze it.</li>
		<li>Open whole map acquisition file in the NMap program.</li>
		<li>Click Analyze > HSCA (?; or something similar)</li>
		<li>Examine the output and adjust the number of nodes as needed.  A good strategy is to "overfit" the model with more clusters than there really
		are, and then merge clusters together to arrive at the appropriate number.</li>
		<li>Click File > export all (?; or something similar) to save the output</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p><i><u>Pros:</u></i> Fast and easy.</p>
	<p><i><u>Cons:</u></i> Requires the user be in the microprobe lab for extra time.  Doesn't work well for images larger than ~3E+5 pixels (the software
	may crash or run slowly).</p>
	
	<h3>JEOL's old cluster analysis software</h3>
	
	<p>Our microprobe has another older program that can be used to manually select clusters using a ternary plot created from three channels.  This can
	be figured out if the lab manager digs through his notes and searches hard through his memory...</p>
	
	<h3>Other clustering methods</h3>
	
	<p>A brief internet search will show you that many methods are available out in the wild for segmenting images, and these rely on various supervised
	and unsupervised machine learning/classification algorithms.  Software implementations for these abound! Here are a few examples:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>XMapTools: Pierre Lanari's (sp?) MatLab-based program is intended to be used for creating quant maps, but creates phase maps using a "random forest"
		decision tree algorithm to segment the images as part of the quantification process.</li>
		<li>Lowell's random R code: I've written a couple of scripts for generating PCA maps and performing K-means based segmentation.  These are available
		upon request.</li>
		<li>ImageJ/Fiji K-means clustering plugins: I've used an IJ plugin for segmentation before, and I'm sure others are available in the IJ/Fiji
		community.</li>
		<li>Supervised learning and classification with ANNs:  I've also experimented with using ANNs to classify pixels a little bit.  I wouldn't say
		that I "recommend" this method, but it is a potential option worth considering.</li>
	</ul>
