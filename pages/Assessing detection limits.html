	<h1>Estimating quantitative detection limits</h1>
    
	<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> more information about this subject can be found in section 8.5 in "the Reed book" starting on page 142, and also in my lecture
	about uncertainty.</p>
	
	<p>The easiest and most straightforward option for assessing detection limits is to just perform a standardless quantitative analysis on the sample
	of interest.  With this approach, you can experiment with different beam currents and count times without needing to perform a full calibration.  This
	could also be done using the "X-ray measure" tool, but that approach introduces more opportunities for user error although it is sometimes more beneficial
	as a pedagogical approach.</p>
	
	<p>Here's the process for assessing uncertainties and detection limits using the standardless analysis method:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Analyse the material of interest using the EDS detector to identify which elements are present, and at what concentrations.</li>
		<li>Set up a quantitative analysis recipe for the material including the major elements identified using EDS and the trace elements of interest,
		and leave the calibration stantard as "Cal-Std".</li>
		<li>Analyze the material of interest using the standardless WDS recipe.</li>
		<li>Open the quantitative analysis result returned as a ".wt" file, and note the following values:
			<ul>
				<li>"Net(cps)": This is the current-normalized net count rate above background.</li>
				<li>"Bg-" and "Bg+": These are the current-normalized background count rates.</li>
				<li>"S.D.(%)": This is the relative standard deviation of the analysis determined based on counting statistics.</li>
				<li>"D.L.(ppm)": This is the detection limit calculated from counting statistics defined as three standard deviations above background.</li>
			</ul>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Now consider this: it is commonly accepted that an analyte is "detectable" if its signal is 3 standard deviations above a background signal
	(usually determined by analyzing a blank that is presumed to contain none of the analyte).  Similarly the concentration of the analyte is
	considered to be "quantifiable" if its signal is 10 standard deviations above background.  This is based on the statistical definitions of "false
	positive" and "false negative" errors.  While I don't generally advocate the use of statistics, I do think these concepts are useful for quantitative
	analyses (and mapping) because they do tend to conform to most users expectations regarding data quality.</p>
	
	<p>Calculating the number of standard deviation above background is fairly straightforward: just take the square root of the mean of both background
	count rates -- that gives you the standard deviation of the background count rate -- and then divide the net count rate by this number.  If the result
	is greater than 3, then the element is detectable.  If it's greater than 10, then the element is quantifiable.</p>
	
	<p>If you're not happy with the peak-to-background ratio that you're getting, then these are your options:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Increase the beam current</li>
		<li>Increase the count time (note that for trace elements both background count times should approach the peak count time)</li>
		<li>Increase the accelerating voltage (is the overvoltage ratio sufficiently high for the X-ray you're trying to excite?)</li>
	</ul>
