	<h1>Time-dependent intensity</h1>
    
	<p>A fundamental assumption we make when doing quantitative analyses is that the X-ray count rate is constant because it depends only on the
	composition of the sample.  This is generally a good assumption, but it is not always true.  A few factors can potentially cause the count
	rate to change over time, including:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Beam damage</li>
		<li>Diffusion effects</li>
		<li>Carbon deposition</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Strategies for identifying and correcting for these effects are discussed below.</p>
	
	<h3>Sample heating</h3>
	
	<p>One of the many electron-sample interactions that we need to consider is sample heating.  Sample heating can be modeled using the simple empirical
	equation found on p. 19 in "the Reed book" but we usually notice it happening by accident.  In principle, one can predict if beam damage is likely to
	occur by calculating the increase in temperature of the sample using the equation.  To do this, just look up the thermal conductivity of the material
	as well as its maximum stable temperature, and substitute these values into the equation along with the beam conditions to be used.  If the calculated
	change in temperature would raise the sample temperature to a point where it becomes unstable, then use of a larger diameter beam or less beam power
	(accelerating voltage and current) is required.</p>
	
	<h3>Using the chart recorder</h3>
	
	<p>The equation used to model sample heating is not time-dependent, but the effects of sample heating are almost certainly kinetically-limited.  We
	can monitor the condition of the sample in real time using the chart recorder tool to get an indication of how fast the sample is changing as it is
	exposed to the beam.  Here is an example procedure to do this:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Navigate to a representative location that is suitable for testing.</li>
		<li>Insert the PCD.</li>
		<li>In the "beam settings" tab (right side of the "SEM Center" window), click "beam diameter" and change the beam diameter to the desired value.</li>
		<li>Click the "spot" button to stop beam scanning, and put it in spot mode.</li>
		<li>Move the spectrometers to the desired positions for the X-rays of interest.</li>
		<li>Select the chart recorder tab in the "PC-EPMA" program and pop out the window.</li>
		<li>Click the "play/start" button to begin recording data, and wait a few seconds for the data to start collecting.</li>
		<li>Retract the PCD, and watch to observe what happens.</li>
		<li>When the experiment is finished, insert the PCD again</li>
		<li>Don't forget to change the beam diameter back to 0</li>
		<li>Have a look at your sample using the SED and/or BED-C to see if anything changed.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Did the sample/adsorbed current change over time?  What about the X-ray count rate?  If the X-ray count rate changed, then it may be necessary to
	use a larger beam diameter or decrease the beam power.</p>
	
	<p>You may have noticed that when the PCD is inserted, you see the nominal value that you would expect for your recipe, and when the PCD is retracted,
	you see a smaller number.  When the PCD is inserted, it is directly reading the flow of electrons in the beam, which corresponds to the electron dose
	that you want delivered to your sample.  When the PCD is retracted, the system instead reports the amount of current that is conducted to ground through
	the sample, the conductive coating, and the sample holder.  When the sample is beam-stable, the adsorbed current shouldn't change significantly.  When
	the adsorbed current changes, it indicates that the electrical properties of the sample are changing -- a potential indication of beam damage.</p>
	
	<h3>Correcting for TDI</h3>
	
	<p>In addition to using the chart recorder, another great way to assess TDI is to perform replicate analyses on the same spot -- just analyse the spot
	in the same location over and over again.  If the rate of change in the count rate is slow, then you may not notice TDI using the chart recorder, but
	you will certainly notice with replicate analyses.  Once you have collected a sufficient number of replicate analyses, you can correct for TDI using
	one of these two general approaches:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li><b><u>The lazy empirical approach:</u></b> Simply fit a function to the compositions that you obtain, and extrapolate the compositional trend
		back to the "zeroth" analysis or "t = 0".  Strictly speaking this doesn't rigorously apply the appropriate matrix effect correction to the corrected
		sample composition, but it will basically get the job done.</li>
		<li><b><u>The rigorous approach:</u></b> in principle, what you *should* do is extrapolate the raw X-ray count rates to "t = 0" and then use the
		corrected count rates to calculate a new matrix-corrected composition.  I know that this can be done in "Probe for EPMA" but there is almost
		certainly a JEOL software solution for this as well.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Carbon deposition</h3>
	
	<p>Another phenomenon that can produce a time-dependent X-ray intensity is carbon deposition.  While we would like for there to be a perfect vacuum
	inside the microprobe, the reality is that a small amount of gas is always present.  This includes a small amount of carbon contamination from a
	variety of sources.  Some labs go to great lengths to minimize this carbon contamination using specialized hardware like plasma cleaners and cryogenic
	traps, but we don't have any of these countermeasures.  Carbon contamination is deposited on the surface of the sample at the edge of the beam.  This
	can be seen in X-ray maps as a "donut" shape or in SED images as a dark spot (?).</p>
	
	<p>Carbon contamination is a big problem for the analysis of carbon in steels.  A potential workaround is to use replicate analyses or empirical
	quantitative mapping to minimize the amount of time that is spent analyzing individual areas.</p>
