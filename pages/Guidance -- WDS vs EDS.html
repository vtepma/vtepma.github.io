	<h1>WDS vs EDS</h1>
	
	<p><i>Rev. 12/03/2024 LRM</i></p>
    
	<p><b>Note:</b> WDS and EDS can both be used for quantitative analysis.  The methods are implemented in a few different ways on our microprobe,
	and users must choose between them -- or at least make decisions about when/whether to use these methods for quantification.  WDS generally is
	more accurate and precise, but requires more time, training, and effort.  EDS generally is faster and easier than WDS, but not quite as
	accurate or precise.  As such, the choice of whether to use WDS or EDS can be fraimed as "is WDS worth the extra effort compared to EDS?"</p>
	
	<p><b>Note:</b> I make a few references below to larger numbers of analyses or transicts/grids working better for WDS than EDS.  This
	is because the software for collecting EDS spectra (SEM Center) is intended for the manual placement of EDS analyses (i.e. clicking on
	the field of view with the mouse pointer) while the software for collecting WDS data (PC-EPMA) is intended for locating points within the
	context of the stage coordinate system.  PC-EPMA actually CAN be used to collect EDS data, but I tend to trust the DTSA-II program more
	than JEOL's software because there is better documentation/community support for DTSA-II.  More testing in this area is needed.</p>
	
	<h3>FAQs</h3>
	
	<p><b>Q:</b> Can I get an analytical total with EDS?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes, EDS quantification can be done using standards, just like WDS.  When a standards-based callibration is used, elemental
	concentrations are determined independently, so they can be summed to obtain an analytical total.</p>
	<br>
	
	<p><b>Q:</b> Can I do standardless analyses using WDS?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes, the software on our microprobe includes a factory calibration for the WDS detectors, which is similar to that of the EDS
	detector.  This is done by selecting "Cal-Std" in the "PC-EPMA" program.</p>
	<br>
	
	<p><b>Q:</b> Can I use a combination of WDS and EDS in the same analysis?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes, this can be done using the "PC-EPMA" program.</p>
	<br>
	
	<p><b>Q:</b> How do I do standards-based analyses using the EDS system?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Here are the options of which I am currently aware:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the "PC-EPMA" program as you would for WDS.</li>
		<li>Collect spectra using the "SEM Center" program, and then post-process the data using the NIST "DTSA-II" program.</li>
		<li>I think there is a way to save/use standards within the "SEM Center"/"SmileView" program(s). (???)</li>
	</ul>
