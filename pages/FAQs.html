	<h1>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h1>

	<p><b>Q:</b> Can I use the microprobe remotely?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes, the instrument is available for remote use.  Ask the lab manager for details.</p>
	<br>

	<p><b>Q:</b> How should I prepare my sample for analysis on the microprobe?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> The following considerations should be made when preparing samples for analysis using the microprobe:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Will the sample fit in the sample holder?
			<ul>
				<li>Samples must be in a format suitable for one of the several sample holders available:</li>
				<li><u>Thin section holder:</u> holds three vertically-oriented, standard-sized petrographic thin/thick sections (27 mm x 46 mm).</li>
				<li><u>1-inch round holder:</u> holds six circular samples with 1-inch (25 mm) diameter</li>
				<li><u>3 cm round holder:</u> holds three samples with a 3 cm diameter</li>
				<li><u>“Universal” sample holder:</u> holds one irregularly-shaped sample with dimensions approximately 45 mm x 70 mm, depending
				on the shape.</li>
				<li><u>5 cm round holder:</u> holds one large circular sample with a 5 cm diameter</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Is the sample smooth, flat, and non-conductive?
			<ul>
				<li>For best results (quantitative chemical analyses), samples should be well-polished to a “mirror-like” finish.</li>
				<li>For standards-based chemical analyses, samples should be coated using the same material and thickness as our standards
				(20 nm carbon).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>		
	<br>

	<p><b>Q:</b> I don’t have the necessary facilities for sample preparation.  Do you have any equipment I could use for cutting/crushing/polishing
	/coating my sample?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> The Petrology Lab in the Geosciences Department has a sample prep lab in Derring Hall which includes the necessary equipment for
	sample preparation.  Access to the lab may be granted based on the individual needs of the user in consultation with the Petrology Lab PI.
	Ask the microprobe lab manager for more information.</p>
	<br>
	
	<p><b>Q:</b> Is the microprobe available on weekends and holidays?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes, the microprobe is available on weekends and holidays.  However, on these days the lab manager’s available to provide in-person
	or remote assistance is limited.</p>
	<br>
	
	<p><b>Q:</b> How do I retrieve my data from the microprobe?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Not using a portable USB drive!  We use FileZilla to transfer data over the network.  Ask the lab manager for details.
	Alternatively, I can email the data to you if you’re a first-time or one-time user.</p>
	<br>
	
	<p><b>Q:</b> When can I retrieve my data?  The instrument is reserved for the next two weeks!</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> You are welcome to retrieve your data any time you want -- even if there is someone else using the microprobe -- EXCEPT if that
	person is a remote user.  And the corollary of this would be, if someone shows up during your session on the microprobe, please try to
	be accommodating and allow the person a few minutes to retrieve their data as needed.</p>

	<p>If someone will be using the probe remotely, I will indicate it on the calendar as "Reserved (remote)".  I will also put a sign on
	the console somewhere to make it obvious that the instrument is being remote-controlled.  You can still retrieve your data during this
	time, but please send me an email (or text) so we can find a safe time for you to go into the lab when the remote user will not be
	controlling the instrument.</p>
	<br>
	
	<p><b>Q:</b> What if I need help using the instrument after hours?</p>
	<p><b>A:</b> You can call/text the lab manager at any time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
	<br>

	<h3>DOs and DON’Ts</h3> 

	<p><b>DO:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Retrieve data using the ICTAS FileZilla server, or ask the lab manager (Lowell) to email the data to you.</li>
		<li>Use the PCD liberally to protect your samples from the beam when nothing is being analyzed.</li>
		<li>Save your data in a named, dated folder in the “EPMA Data” directory on the “E:/…” drive.</li>
		<li>Use the “Jog” button when you’re done moving to a stage position that you intend to save. It helps counteract the effects of
		hysteresis (stage “backlash”) and promote stage reproducibility.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>DON’Ts:</b></p> 
	<ul>
		<li><b>Do not insert any devices into any USB ports in the lab.</b>  You will be permanently banned from using the microprobe in the future!</li>
		<li>Do not push any buttons on the column or try to troubleshoot problems with the instrument. If you encounter any problems, contact
		the lab manager (Lowell)</li> 
		<li>Do not save or edit any data on the “C:/…” drive – that’s for system software and configuration files only.</li>
	</ul>
